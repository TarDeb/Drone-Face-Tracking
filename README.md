# Drone-Face-Tracking
Project Title: Drone Face Tracking with Tello Drone

Description:

This project demonstrates a program a Tello drone using Python for autonomous operations. The primary feature involves capturing the camera feed from the drone and processing it with OpenCV. I implemented face detection technology which allows the drone to identify and follow a face in its viewing range. This functionality showcases real-time adjustments to the droneâ€™s trajectory to maintain focus on the moving subject, highlighting my skills in integrating computer vision techniques with practical drone applications.
